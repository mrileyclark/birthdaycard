# Happy Birthday Joke Generator ðŸ¥³

I wanted to send something fun to my father for his birthday, so I created a birthday card that gives him plenty of "Dad" jokes to fill his day with laughter. This project provides a fun and interactive way to celebrate birthdays by generating jokes for you and your friends to enjoy! It utilizes JavaScript to fetch jokes from the "icanhazdadjoke" API and dynamically updates the joke displayed on the webpage.

# How it works

When the page loads, a joke is automatically generated and displayed.
You can click the "Get Another Joke" button to fetch and display a new joke.
The joke fetching is done asynchronously using the fetch API and async/await.
The project is designed to be responsive, ensuring an optimal viewing experience across different devices.

 ## Lessons Learned: 

I plan on revisting the project to make the card open and close with flip animation.
