# Birthday Card 

****

I wanted to send something special to my father for his birthday, so I created a birthday card that 
gives him plenty of "Dad" jokes to fill his day with laughter.

## How It's Made: 

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API

Birthday Cad - Developed a JavaScript application that utilizes 
the Random Dad jokes API to find breweries in a given city. The user enters 
the city name, and the application fetches relevant brewery data from the API. The 
information is then dynamically displayed in a table format, including details 
such as brewery name, address, city, state, and website URL. I ensured the application
handles potential null values for brewery names and website URLs, following best 
practices for data presentation and error handling.

 ## Lessons Learned: 

I plan on revisting the app to make the card open and close with flip animation.
